## INTRODUCTION

-Light sensors are a simple addition to ambulatory PSG providing objective and valid light data without adding significant complication or expense

## NEED REQUIREMENTS

- 1  x  Arduino UNO

- 1  x  USB 2.0 Cable Type A/B

- 1  x  Light Sensor

- 1  x  10k Ohm Resistor

- n  x  Jumper Wires

## SWOT ANALYSIS

### STRENGTH

-It is easy to integrate with lighting system such as automatic lighting system

### WEEKNESS

-DRs are highly inaccurate with high response time (about 10s or 100s of milliseconds)

### OPPURTUNITY

-In the future, maintenance will rely on sensors instead of being carried out according to a needs-based timetable

-Safety will also improve because unsafe situation will be easily predicted. Autonomous sensor technology will become possible

### TREADS

-Resistance varies continuosly (analog) in photoresistor and are rugged in nature


## 4W & 1H

### WHY

-Light sensors installed as part of a lighting control system measure the amount of ambient light present and adjust the electric lights accordingly

-This is known as daylight harvesting, and helps with energy efficiency by ensuring no electric light is wasted

### WHAT

-Light sensors measure illuminance, which can be used to measure more than the brightness of a light source

-Because the illuminance decreases as the sensor moves away from a steady light, the light sensor can be used to gauge relative distance from the source

### WHEN

-Light sensors sometimes use a component called a photodiode to measure illuminance

-When beams of light strike a photodiode, they have a tendency to knock electrons loose, causing an electric current to flow.

-The brighter the light, the stronger the electric current

## HOW

-The light sensor is a passive device that converts the light energy into an electrical signal output
